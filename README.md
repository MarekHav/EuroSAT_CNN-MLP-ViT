This repository contains a Jupyter notebook created as part of an school project focused on applying different neural network architectures to the EuroSAT dataset.

The notebook explores and compares three model types:
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP)
- Vision Transformers (ViT)

In the following sections:
1) Application of CNN
2) Aplication of MLP
3) Application of Vision Transformer
4) Appliaction of RandomSearch on MLP architecture
5) Appliaction of Data Augmentation on CNN

The goal of this project was to better understand how different architectures perform on satellite image classification tasks and how their behavior differs in practice.

## About this repository

The notebook documents:
- data loading and preprocessing,
- model design and training,
- evaluation and comparison of different architectures,
- visualization of results and intermediate findings.

It reflects my iterative approach to experimentation and model development.
